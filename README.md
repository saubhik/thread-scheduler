------

The goal of the project is to understand and implement the **credit scheduler** in a user-level threads library. 
To do so you must modify the provided GTThreads library. 
The library implements a O(1) priority scheduler and a priority co-scheduler for reference.

You may discuss ideas with colleagues in the class, but the project must be done **individually**. 
Copying others is NEVER allowed for any reason.
