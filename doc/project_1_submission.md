# Project 1 Submission

### 1. General Rule

* Submit your project only through **Canvas**
   Other types of submission will not be accepted, e.g. email.

* Submit two files: program in tarball (``*.tar.gz``) and report in PDF (``*.pdf``)

* Name both files in this format ``project_1_$GTACCOUNT``, e.g. project\_1\_gburdell3

* Compress only the directory **gtthreads**
	- Verify the ``Makefile`` inside working **correctly** on VM cluster to compile/run your program.  
	- Do not pack the binary or metadata files, make sure to clean them (``$ make clean``) before archive your code.
	- Get necessary files or documents ready before you pack it. Like a more clear ``README`` for running your code.
    - Reference command for packing your code: ``$ tar -czvf project_1_$GTACCOUNT.tar.gz ./gtthreads``

### 2. Late Policy

A penalty of 10% per day will be applied for late submissions for up to 3 days. 
Submissions received more than 3 days late will receive no credit.
